### clef2019
- Running the preprocessing script will generate the following files in ``preprocessed/clef2019`` 
    - test/training/development.json
    - unseen label files; each line contains an unseen label as described in file names 
      (if file is empty -> no unseen labels)
    - label distribution for each partition
